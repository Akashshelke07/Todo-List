A brief description of what this project does and who it's for ?

A todo list is a tool used to keep track of tasks that need to be completed. It typically consists of a list of items, each representing a task or activity. Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed, and sometimes set deadlines or priorities for each task. Todo lists help individuals and teams stay organized, prioritize their work, and manage their time effectively by providing a clear overview of what needs to be done. They serve as a helpful reminder of pending tasks and serve as a guide for daily activities, improving productivity and ensuring that important tasks are not overlooked. Overall, todo lists are essential for task management and productivity in both personal and professional settings.
